# LinkedDataProject
**by Alina Danci **

## Introduction
My aim is:
To create an API that will have easy functionality. Design a set of URLs which will be useful for querying the datasets.
Users I imagine using the API: 
People that are interested in Global warming.
Science teachers and students.

##  Datasets used
I have chosen my Datasets from the CSO website.
My first dataset is on the emissions on the air by year, and the second dataset is on the temperature/climate.
I used these datasets because they relate to each other and they are broken down nicely.
These datasets contain statistics on climate and emissions on air.


## Functionality 
The API should be able to query the two datasets.
The API should come with URLs which will make it easier on the user to find data.
The API should order the year by the warmest, and show the emissions for that year.

## Update 1
This week was a but of a struggle with trying to convert my cvs data to json.
I still have a little problem with the Temperature json file, but i will try my best to make it work.
I had to change the data a little to work with my API. 
I Also started to write the API but since there were some errors I decided to take it out for this commit.
